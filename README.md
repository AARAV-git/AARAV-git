## 👋 Hi, I’m Sunny Pathak

I build real-world applications with a focus on clarity, structure, and thoughtful design.

I primarily work with Python and Java, develop mobile applications using Flutter, manage and query databases with SQL, and design user interfaces using Figma and Canva. I enjoy learning by building and continuously improving my technical foundation.
